# webSocket-project
This project demonstrates a simple WebSocket server and client setup for processing messages. The WebSocket server performs three types of processing on received messages and returns the results to the client. The client, implemented in HTML and JavaScript, interacts with the WebSocket server and displays the results in a terminal-like interface.
